# Introduction to Elm
Nate Clark

---

# Personal confessions

- I'm not a front-end dev
- I hate the browser
- Elm lets me keep my sanity

---

# Goals for today

- Learn the basics of the __Elm Architecture__
- Write a __simple program__ in Elm
- Learn basic __language features__ of Elm
- Highlight important __design decisions__ of Elm

*Follow along with slides at [natec425.github.io/olemiss-elm-intro](natec425.github.io/olemiss-elm-intro)*

# The Elm Architecture

Almost every (Elm) application has at least three pieces:
- state
- ways to change the state
- ways to view the state

In Elm, you define your application exactly in terms of these ideas.

Elm has names for each of these pieces:
- state
  - `Model` is the type of your application's state
- ways to change the state
  - `Msg` is the ways your application's state can change
  - `update : Msg -> Model -> Model`
- ways to view the state
  - `view : Model -> Html Msg`

# Describing a counter widget

Our counter widget should allow us to +1 or -1 a number that we are keeping up with.

It might look something like:

<button>-</button>5<button>+</button>

### Questions:

1. What is the state of our application?
1. What are the ways we can change the state of our application?

---

# Questions:

1. What is the state of our application?
  - Int
1. What are the ways we can change the state of our application?
  - add 1
  - subtract 1

### What does this look like in Elm?

```elm
-- The type of my application's state is an integer
type alias Model = Int

-- My state can by changed by adding 1 or subtracting 1
type Msg
  = Add1
  | Sub1

update : Msg -> Model -> Model
update msg model =
  case msg of
    Add1 -> model + 1
    Sub1 -> model - 1
```

---

# What is special about this code?

```elm
type alias Model = Int

-- Algebraic Data Type
type Msg
  = Add1
  | Sub1

update : Msg -> Model -> Model
update msg model =
  -- Pattern Matching
  case msg of
    Add1 -> model + 1
    Sub1 -> model - 1
```

## Important Design Decision!

>> <center><em>The state of my application is completely seperate from the presentation of that state.</em></center>

---

# Progess so far:
- [X] `Model`
- [X] `Msg`
- [X] `update`
- [ ] `view`

>>Any Questions?

---

# Writing the view

```elm
import Html exposing (Html, div, button)
import Html.Events exposing (onClick)

view : Model -> Html Msg
view model =
  div []
      [ button [ onClick Sub1 ] [ text "-" ]
      , text (toString model)
      , button [ onClick Add1 ] [ text "+ "]
      ]
```

---

# What is special about this code?
```elm
import Html exposing (Html, div, button, text)
import Html.Events exposing (onClick)

-- Html Msg represents some Html that is capable of producing a Msg
view : Model -> Html Msg
view model =
  div []
      [ button [ onClick Sub1 ] [ text "-" ]
      , text (toString model)
      , button [ onClick Add1 ] [ text "+ "]
      ]

-- Html elements are essentially collections of attributes and children
-- Html Msg ~= Node [Attribute Msg] [Html Msg]
```

## Important Design Decisions!

>> 1. <em>The view is a pure function of the state of the application.</em>
>> 2. <em>The view is data! Like the stuff we work with every day!</em>

---

# Wiring it all up

```elm
import Html.App exposing (beginnerProgram)

main = beginnerProgram
                    { -- the initial state is 0
                      model = 0
                    , -- the update function is how you update the state
                      update = update
                    , -- the view function is how you show the state
                      view = view
                    }
```

# Important Design Decision!

>> <center><em>Your program is a collection of data; not a series of statements</em></center>

---

# In all its glory

```elm
import Html exposing (Html, div, button, text)
import Html.Events exposing (onClick)
import Html.App exposing (beginnerProgram)

main = beginnerProgram
            { model = 0 , update = update, view = view }

type alias Model = Int

type Msg = Add1 | Sub1

update : Msg -> Model -> Model
update msg model =
  case msg of
    Add1 -> model + 1
    Sub1 -> model - 1

view : Model -> Html Msg
view model =
  div []
      [ button [ onClick Sub1 ] [ text "-" ]
      , text (toString model)
      , button [ onClick Add1 ] [ text "+ "]
      ]
```
